LaTeX source files for [my thesis on Target detection of hyperspectral imagery on FPGAs](https://eprints.ucm.es/id/eprint/62874/). Not really usefull for anyone else, I just don't see any disadvantage in having it online.

I initially created this repository to track changes locally, so it may not be as clean as it should be. Notice that the license is different to the other repos of my thesis.

There are three repositories that make up my thesis:

 1. [target_vhdl](https://github.com/martinbarez/target_vhdl) for the VHDL source code
 2. [target-detection](https://github.com/martinbarez/target-detection) the python simulation and plotting I used
 3. [target_tex](https://github.com/martinbarez/target_tex) the LaTeX files for the thesis (this one)
