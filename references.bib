	abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging is an important technique in remote sensing which is characterized by high spectral resolutions. With the advent of new hyperspectral remote sensing missions and their increased temporal resolutions, the availability and dimensionality of hyperspectral data is continuously increasing. This demands fast processing solutions that can be used to compress and/or interpret hyperspectral data onboard spacecraft imaging platforms in order to reduce downlink connection requirements and perform a more efficient exploitation of hyperspectral data sets in various applications. Over the last few years, reconfigurable hardware solutions such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been consolidated as the standard choice for onboard remote sensing processing due to their smaller size, weight, and power consumption when compared with other high-performance computing systems, as well as to the availability of more FPGAs with increased tolerance to ionizing radiation in space. Although there have been many literature sources on the use of FPGAs in remote sensing in general and in hyperspectral remote sensing in particular, there is no specific reference discussing the state-of-the-art and future trends of applying this flexible and dynamic technology to such missions. In this work, a necessary first step in this direction is taken by providing an extensive review and discussion of the (current and future) capabilities of reconfigurable hardware and FPGAs in the context of hyperspectral remote sensing missions. The review covers both technological aspects of FPGA hardware and implementation issues, providing two specific case studies in which FPGAs are successfully used to improve the compression and interpretation (through spectral unmixing concepts) of remotely sensed hyperspectral data. Based on the two considered case studies, we also highlight the major challenges to be addressed in the near future in this emerging and fast growing research area.},

The automatic target-generation process using an orthogonal projection operator (ATGP-OSP) has been widely used for this purpose. Hyperspectral target-detection applications require timely responses for swift decisions, which depend upon (near) real-time performance of algorithm analysis. Reconfigurable field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are promising platforms that allow hardware/software codesign and the potential to provide powerful onboard computing capabilities and flexibility at the same time. In this paper, we present an FPGA implementation for the ATGP-OSP algorithm. Our system includes a direct memory access module and implements a prefetching technique to hide the latency of the input/output communications. The proposed method has been implemented on a Virtex-7 XC7VX690T FPGA and tested using real hyperspectral data collected by NASA's Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over the Cuprite mining district in Nevada and the World Trade Center in New York. Experimental results demonstrate that our hardware version of the ATGP-OSP algorithm can significantly outperform a software version, which makes our reconfigurable system appealing for onboard hyperspectral data processing.},

	abstract = {En los últimos años, el análisis de imágenes hiperespectrales en observación remota, se ha convertido en un campo de investigación muy activo. Actualmente, debido a la resolución espacial disponible en los sensores presentes en plataformas aéreas o satelitales y a la manera en que aparecen los distintos materiales en la naturaleza, en una imagen hiperespectral podemos encontrar dos tipos de píxeles:puros y mezclas. La diferencia entre ellos es que su firma espectral se corresponde con un único material (puro) o es la combinación de varios de ellos (mezcla).Para realizar el análisis de la composición de cada uno de los píxeles de la imagen hiperespectral se utiliza frecuentemente la técnica de desmezclado espectral. En determinadas situaciones no nos interesa realizar un análisis completo de la imagen, generalmente por el excesivo tiempo de ejecución que ello conllevaría, y es suficiente aplicar técnicas de análisis consistentes en la detección de anomalías. Para realizar dicha detección, existe un enfoque desarrollado por Reed y Yu, el cual es conocido comúnmente como algoritmo RX. Es en esta última técnica en la que se basa este trabajo. En este proyecto fin de carrera se ha diseñado e implementado el algoritmo RX completo a excepción de la obtención de la matriz de covarianza, la cual ya se supondrá calculada. Para la especificación de dicha implementación se ha empleado el lenguaje de descripción hardware VHDL y se ha orientado a su uso en plataformas de hardware reconfigurable del tipo Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).
[ABSTRACT]
In the latest years, remotely sensed hyperspectral imaging has become a very active research field. Nowadays, due to the available spatial resolution of the sensors in remote sensing of the Earth and the way the different materials appear in nature, in a hyperspectral image can be found two different types of pixels: pures and mixtures.
The difference between them is that its spectral sign corresponds to a unique material (pure ones) or is the blend of some of them (mixture ones). To perform the analysis of each pixel’s composition of the hyperspectral image it is frequently used the technique of spectral unmixing. In certain situations, it is not of interest to perform a whole analysis of the image, usually due to the excessive runtime that will take, and is enough with only applying techniques of anomaly detection. A well-known approach for anomaly detection was developed by Reed and Yu, and is referred to as the RX algorithm. It is in this technique in what it is based this work. In this project it has been designed and implemented the whole RX algorithm but the covariance matrix, which will be assumed as given. The design proposed has been developed in reconfigurable platforms like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) using the VHDL language for its specification.},

	abstract = {The energy consumption of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is dominated by leakage currents and dynamic energy associated with programmable interconnect. An FPGA built entirely from nanoelectromechanical (NEM) relays can effectively eliminate leakage energy losses, reduce the interconnect dynamic energy, operate at temperatures {\textgreater}225 °C and tolerate radiation doses in excess of 100 Mrad, while hybrid FPGAs comprising both complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors and NEM relays (NEM-CMOS) have the potential to realize improvements in performance and energy efficiency. Large-scale integration of NEM relays, however, poses a significant engineering challenge due to the presence of moving parts. We discuss the design of FPGAs utilizing NEM relays based on a heterogeneous 3-D integration scheme, and carry out a scaling study to quantify key metrics related to performance and energy efficiency in both NEM-only and NEM-CMOS FPGAs. We show how the integration scheme has a profound effect on these metrics by changing the length of global wires. The scaling regime beyond which net performance and energy benefits is seen in NEM-CMOS over a baseline 90 nm CMOS technology is defined by an effective relay beam length of 0.5 \${\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm\$ , on-resistance of 200 \${\textbackslash}textkØmega\$ , and a via pitch of 0.4 \${\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}textm\$ , all achievable with existing process technology. For ultra-low energy applications that are not performance critical, NEM-only FPGAs can provide close to \$15{\textbackslash}times\$ improvement in energy efficiency.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed hyperspectral sensors provide image data containing rich information in both the spatial and the spectral domain, and this information can be used to address detection tasks in many applications. One of the most widely used and successful algorithms for anomaly detection in hyperspectral images is the RX algorithm. Despite its wide acceptance and high computational complexity when applied to real hyperspectral scenes, few approaches have been developed for parallel implementation of this algorithm. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of using a hybrid parallel implementation with a high-dimensional hyperspectral scene. A general strategy to automatically map parallel hybrid anomaly detection algorithms for hyperspectral image analysis has been developed. Parallel RX has been tested on an heterogeneous cluster using this routine. The considered approach is quantitatively evaluated using hyperspectral data collected by the NASA’s Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer system over the World Trade Center in New York, 5 days after the terrorist attacks. The numerical effectiveness of the algorithms is evaluated by means of their capacity to automatically detect the thermal hot spot of fires (anomalies). The speedups achieved show that a cluster of multi-core nodes can highly accelerate the RX algorithm.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) has been introduced in recent years as a method to increase the flexibility of FPGA designs. However, using DPR for building complex systems remains a daunting task. Recently, approaches based on Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and UML MARTE standard have emerged which aim to simplify the design of complex SoCs, and in some cases, DPR systems. Nevertheless, many of these approaches lacked a standard intermediate representation to pass from high-levels of descriptions to executable models. However, with the recent standardization of the IP-XACT specification, there is an increasing interest to use it in MDE methodologies to ease system integration and to enable design flow automation. In this paper we propose an MARTE/MDE approach which exploits the capabilities of IP-XACT to model and automatically generate DPR SoC designs. We present the MARTE modeling concepts and how these models are mapped to IP-XACT objects; the emphasis is given to the generation of IP cores that can be used in the Xilinx EDK (Embedded Design Kit) environment, since we aim to develop a complete flow around their Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration design flow. Finally, we present a case study integrating the presented concepts, showing the benefits in design efforts compared with a purely VHDL approach and using solely EDK. Experimental results show a reduction of the design efforts required to obtain the netlist required for the DPR design flow from hours required in VHDL and Xilinx EDK, to less the one hour and minutes for IP integration.},

	abstract = {The main contribution of this paper is to present a new FPGA architecture for the Hough transform that identifies straight lines in a binary image. Recent FPGAs have hundreds of embedded DSP slices and block RAMs. For example, Xilinx Virtex-6 Family FPGAs have a DSP48E1 slice, which is a configurable logic block equipped with fast multipliers, adders, pipeline registers, and so on. They also have a dual-port memory with 18Kbits as a block RAM. One of the most important key techniques for accelerating computation using FPGAs is an efficient usage ofDSP slices and block RAMs. Our new architecture for the Hough transform uses 178 DSP48E1 slices and 180 block RAMs with 18Kbits that work in parallel. As far as we know, there is no previously published work that fully utilizes DSP slices and block RAMs for the Hough transform. Roughly speaking, a conventional sequential implementation performs 180m voting operations for m edge points. Our architecture performs voting operations in parallel, and outputs identified straight lines in m+97 clock cycles. Since 180m voting operations are performed using 178 DSP48E1 slices, the lower bound of the computing time is m clock cycles. Hence our implementation is close to optimal. The implementation results show that the Hough transform for a 512×512 image with 33232 edge points can be done in only 135.75us.},

	abstract = {The spectral signatures of the materials contained in hyperspectral images (HI), also called endmembers (EM), can be significantly affected by variations in atmospheric, illumination or environmental conditions typically occurring within an HI. Traditional spectral unmixing (SU) algorithms neglect the spectral variability of the endmembers, what propagates significant mismodeling errors throughout the whole unmixing process and compromises the quality of its results. Therefore, large efforts have been recently dedicated to mitigate the effects of spectral variability in SU. This resulted in the development of algorithms that incorporate different strategies to allow the EMs to vary within an HI, using, for instance, sets of spectral signatures known a priori, Bayesian, parametric, or local EM models. Each of these approaches has different characteristics and underlying motivations. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review contextualizing both classic and recent approaches to solve this problem. We give a detailed evaluation of the sources of spectral variability and their effect in HI spectra. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy that organizes existing work according to a practitioner's point of view, based on the necessary amount of supervision and on the computational cost they require. We also review methods used to construct spectral libraries (which are required by many SU techniques) based on the observed HI, as well as algorithms for library augmentation and reduction.

	abstract = {Multi-FPGA boards are widely used for rapid system prototyping. As the ratio between the logic capacity and the number of I/Os for each FPGA generation is increasing, FPGA I/Os are becoming a scarce resource. In order to resolve pin limitation problem, cut nets are sent between FPGAs in a pipelined way using the Time-Division-Multiplexing technique. The maximum number of cut nets passing through one FPGA I/O is called the TDM ratio. There are three inter-FPGA communication architectures: Logic Multiplexing, ISERDES/OSERDES and Multi-Gigabit Transceiver (MGT). Only Logic Multiplexing and ISERDES/OSERDES are today used for Time-Division-Multiplexing in the multi-FPGA based prototyping. In this paper, the achieved performance of Logic Multiplexing and ISERDES/OSERDES is compared in different TDM ratios and a hybrid multiplexing architecture using both ISERDES/OSERDES and MGT is proposed. Experiments are done in a multi-FPGA board with the testbench LFSR to validate the achieved performance. The results show that even though consuming more FPGA I/Os for data transmission, ISERDES/OSERDES can achieve higher performance than Logic Multiplexing. The proposed architecture can achieve higher performance than ISERDES/OSERDES when the TDM ratio exceeds 54. The maximum gain in performance is about 20\%.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) in hyperspectral data has received a lot of attention for various applications. The aim of anomaly detection is to detect pixels in the hyperspectral data cube whose spectra differ significantly from the background spectra. Many anomaly detectors have been proposed in the literature. They differ in the way the background is characterized and in the method used for determining the difference between the current pixel and the background. The most well-known anomaly detector is the RX detector that calculates the Mahalanobis distance between the pixel under test (PUT) and the background. Global RX characterizes the background of the complete scene by a single multivariate normal probability density function. In many cases, this model is not appropriate for describing the background. For that reason a variety of other anomaly detection methods have been developed. This paper examines three classes of anomaly detectors: subspace methods, local methods, and segmentation-based methods. Representative examples of each class are chosen and applied on a set of hyperspectral data with diverse complexity. The results are evaluated and compared.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a tutorial overview on anomaly detection for hyperspectral electro-optical systems is presented. This tutorial is focused on those techniques that aim to detect small man-made anomalies typically found in defense and surveillance applications. Since a variety of methods have been proposed for detecting such targets, this tutorial places emphasis on the techniques that are either mathematically more tractable or easier to interpret physically. These methods are not only more suitable for a tutorial publication, but also an essential to a study of anomaly detection. Previous surveys on this subject have focused mainly on anomaly detectors developed in a statistical framework and have been based on well-known background statistical models. However, the most recent research trends seem to move away from the statistical framework and to focus more on deterministic and geometric concepts. This work also takes into consideration these latest trends, providing a wide theoretical review without disregarding practical recommendations about algorithm implementation. The main open research topics are addressed as well, the foremost being algorithm optimization, which is required for embodying anomaly detectors in real-time systems.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral (HS) images usually have high spectral resolution and low spatial resolution (LSR). However, multispectral (MS) images have high spatial resolution (HSR) and low spectral resolution. HS\&ndash;MS image fusion technology can combine both advantages, which is beneficial for accurate feature classification. Nevertheless, heterogeneous sensors always have temporal differences between LSR-HS and HSR-MS images in the real cases, which means that the classical fusion methods cannot get effective results. For this problem, we present a fusion method via spectral unmixing and image mask. Considering the difference between the two images, we firstly extracted the endmembers and their corresponding positions from the invariant regions of LSR-HS images. Then we can get the endmembers of HSR-MS images based on the theory that HSR-MS images and LSR-HS images are the spectral and spatial degradation from HSR-HS images, respectively. The fusion image is obtained by two result matrices. Series experimental results on simulated and real datasets substantiated the effectiveness of our method both quantitatively and visually.},

	abstract = {Using hyperspectral (HS) technology, this paper introduces an autonomous scene anomaly detection approach based on the asymptotic behavior of a semiparametric model under amultisample testing andminimum-order statistic scheme. Scene anomaly detection has a wide range of use in remote sensing applications, requiring no specific material signatures. Uniqueness of the approach includes the following: (i) only a small fraction of the HS cube is required to characterize the unknown clutter background, while existing global anomaly detectors require the entire cube; (ii) the utility of a semiparematric model, where underlying distributions of spectra are not assumed to be known but related through an exponential function; (iii) derivation of the asymptotic cumulative probability of the approach making mistakes, allowing the user some control of probabilistic errors. Results using real HS data are promising for autonomous manmade object detection in difficult natural clutter backgrounds from two viewing perspectives: nadir and forward looking.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection becomes increasingly important in hyperspectral image analysis, since hyperspectral imagers can now uncover many material substances which were previously unresolved by multispectral sensors. Two types of anomaly detection are of interest and considered in this paper. One was previously developed by Reed and Yu to detect targets whose signatures are distinct from their surroundings. Another was designed to detect targets with low probabilities in an unknown image scene. Interestingly, they both operate the same form as does a matched filter. Moreover, they can be implemented in real-time processing, provided that the sample covariance matrix is replaced by the sample correlation matrix. One disadvantage of an anomaly detector is the lack of ability to discriminate the detected targets from another. In order to resolve this problem, the concept of target discrimination measures is introduced to cluster different types of anomalies into separate target classes. By using these class means as target information, the detected anomalies can be further classified. With inclusion of target discrimination in anomaly detection, anomaly classification can be implemented in a three-stage process, first by anomaly detection to find potential targets, followed by target discrimination to cluster the detected anomalies into separate target classes, and concluded by a classifier to achieve target classification. Experiments show that anomaly classification performs very differently from anomaly detection.},

	abstract = {Accurate covariance matrix estimation for high-dimensional data can be a difficult problem. A good approximation of the covariance matrix needs in most cases a prohibitively large number of pixels, that is, pixels from a stationary section of the image whose number is greater than several times the number of bands. Estimating the covariance matrix with a number of pixels that is on the order of the number of bands or less will cause not only a bad estimation of the covariance matrix but also a singular covariance matrix which cannot be inverted. In this paper we will investigate two methods to give a sufficient approximation for the covariance matrix while only using a small number of neighboring pixels. The first is the quasilocal covariance matrix (QLRX) that uses the variance of the global covariance instead of the variances that are too small and cause a singular covariance. The second method is sparse matrix transform (SMT) that performs a set of K-givens rotations to estimate the covariance matrix. We will compare results from target acquisition that are based on both of these methods. An improvement for the SMT algorithm is suggested.},
