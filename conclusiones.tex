Hyperspectral image processing is a very powerful tool that facilitates mining operations, target tracking or contamination analysis. The technological advances in these cameras accentuates the need to perform this type of analysis on board and with it the use of specific platforms such as FPGAs.
\\
\\
The complete analysis of this type of images is not always feasible and target detection algorithms such as the one presented here allow not only a significant reduction in bandwidth requirements but also allow the use of this type of sensors in real-time applications.
\\
\\
The results obtained are positive since they show a reduction in the use of resources and  compared to other previous implementations thanks to its approach through the use of fixed point logic. The use of a reconfigurable platform also allows the precision of this system to be adjusted even after it has been put into operation.
